# align-task-meet

I'm building a business alignment OS consisting of two main parts: a task manager where activities and due dates are kept and organized and owners are held accountable for and a meeting manager for running effective and efficient meetings. the meeting manager consists of three main parts: 
1. Pre-meeting Preparation: Our unique tool ensures well-structured meetings. Optimized agendas, surfaced issues and opportunities, and prepared participants lead to focused discussions. Users suggest topics and share pre-read materials conveniently, with host approval maintaining order.
2. In-meeting Collaboration: Asynchronous and synchronous brainstorming and polls leverage the collective intelligence of your team, leading to better decisions and agreements. Real-time collaboration drives engagement and ensures everyone's voice is heard.
3. Post-meeting Action and Follow-up: Meetings never fade into oblivion. Summarized outcomes with clear deadlines and assigned "Direct Responsible Individuals" (DRIs) drive accountability. Pre-populated agendas for follow-up meetings guarantee nothing falls through the cracks.
